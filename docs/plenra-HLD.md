Here’s the **production-grade `.md` documentation** for Plenra.
This is not marketing fluff. This is a system spec your developers and DevOps can execute on.

# Plenra - Decision Infrastructure System

**Version:** v1.0 Production Blueprint
**Type:** Deterministic Decision Authorization Network
**Mode:** Fail-Closed, Signal-Based, Non-Heuristic

---

# 1. What Plenra Is

Plenra is a **Decision Authorization Infrastructure**.

Not analytics.
Not AI recommendations.
Not dashboards.

**It is a system that decides whether an action is allowed to happen.**

### Core Output

Every flow ends with:

```
PASS | HOLD | REDUCE | STOP | COOLDOWN | MANUAL_REVIEW
```

### Core Principle

Plenra operates **before execution**, not after.

---

# 2. Purpose of the System

### Primary Goal

Prevent bad decisions at scale.

### Secondary Goals

* Reduce capital loss
* Stabilize scaling decisions
* Create a learning dataset of decision outcomes
* Enable deterministic optimization loops

---

# 3. System Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

### 3.1 Fail-Closed

If input is invalid → system does NOT proceed.

### 3.2 Deterministic Only

* No randomness
* No guesswork
* No generative logic in decision layer

### 3.3 Separation of Concerns

* Decision = Plenra
* Execution = external systems
* Orchestration = Make.com

### 3.4 No Override Culture

Overrides are logged, never silent.

# 5. Core Layers Explained

---

## 5.1 Input Layer

### Sources

* User input (manual / chat UI)
* Platform triggers (Sonary, Ads, etc.)
* Metrics systems (GA4, DB, SEO)

### Examples

* Budget increase request
* ROI drop alert
* CPC spike
* Performance instability

---

## 5.2 Intake Layer

### Purpose

Normalize input into strict contract.

### Modes

* Structured form
* Free text (LLM parsing layer)

### Output

```ts
type DecisionGateInput = {
  vertical_id: string
  roi_value: number
  rolling_roi_value: number
  effective_cpc: number
  effective_conversion_rate: number
  ...
}
```

### Rules

* No missing required fields
* No invalid enums
* No NaN values

---

## 5.3 Decision Gate Layer (CORE)

### Role

Decides if action is allowed.

### Engine

`decision_gate_service`

### Input

Strict validated contract

### Output

```ts
{
  decision_status: "pass | hold | reduce | stop | cooldown | manual_review",
  decision_action: "scale_up | maintain | reduce_15 | reduce_30 | pause",
  reason_code: string,
  gate_severity: "low | medium | high"
}
```

---

### Core Logic Examples

#### 1. ROI-based blocking

```
IF rolling_roi < threshold → HOLD or STOP
```

#### 2. Fake Winner detection

```
IF is_fake_winner = true → REDUCE or STOP
```

#### 3. Dominance risk

```
IF share too high → REDUCE
```

#### 4. CPC inflation

```
IF CPC rising + conversion dropping → HOLD
```

---

## 5.4 Meta Controller Layer

### Role

Protects system integrity.

### Responsibilities

* Input validation classification
* Trust level assignment
* Learning permission control

### Key Outputs

```ts
{
  controller_status: "allow_updates | block_updates",
  trust_level: "high | low | quarantined",
  normalization_applied: boolean
}
```

### Critical Rule

**No learning from untrusted data.**

---

## 5.5 Decision Ledger Layer

### Role

Tracks full decision lifecycle.

### Required Chain

```
decision_event → execution_event → outcome_event
```

### Guarantees

* No missing steps
* No evaluation without full chain

---

## 5.6 Dataset Builder Layer

### Role

Controls what enters learning dataset.

### Rules

* Block invalid data
* Classify trust
* Route to:

  * clean dataset
  * low_trust dataset
  * quarantine

---

## 5.7 Counterfactual Engine

### Role

Measure decision impact.

### Calculates

* baseline performance
* actual performance
* decision_gain
* prevented_loss

### Example

```
baseline_profit = expected
actual_profit = real

decision_gain = actual - baseline
```

---

## 5.8 Decision Intelligence Layer

### Role

Extract patterns.

### Groups

* ROI ranges
* CPC behavior
* share buckets
* performance_status

---

## 5.9 Weight Update Engine

### Role

Adjust global decision weights.

### Constraints

* max change per cycle = 0.05
* normalized sum = 1
* bounded [0.1 - 1.0]

### Controlled by

Meta Controller only

---

# 6. Queue Architecture (BullMQ)

### Core Queues

```
decision_queue
ledger_queue
dataset_builder_queue
counterfactual_queue
intelligence_queue
weight_update_queue
audit_queue
```

---

### Example Flow

```
decision_queue
→ ledger_queue
→ dataset_builder_queue
→ counterfactual_queue
→ intelligence_queue
→ weight_update_queue
```

---

### Idempotency Rule

Every worker must use:

```
decision_id + ":" + stage
```

---

# 7. Worker Pattern

### Worker Responsibilities

* receive job
* check idempotency
* call pure service
* persist result
* trigger next queue

### NEVER:

* contain business logic
* skip persistence
* bypass audit

---

# 8. Storage Architecture

### PostgreSQL

#### Tables

1. decision_events
2. dataset_records
3. learning_dataset

### Rules

* JSONB for flexibility
* strict audit fields
* no mutation of history

---

# 9. Orchestration Layer

### Tool

Make.com

### Responsibilities

* webhook ingestion
* routing
* approval flows
* logging

### Rule

**Persist first → trigger next**

---

# 10. UI Layer (POC)

### Minimal Chat UI

Components:

* textarea
* submit button
* response box

### Flow

```
user input → intake → decision → response
```

# 11. Agents in the System

---

## 11.1 Central Agent

* owns system logic
* enforces guardrails
* manages architecture

---

## 11.2 Decision Gate Agent

* executes decisions
* applies rules

---

## 11.3 Meta Controller Agent

* protects system
* blocks bad data

---

## 11.4 Dataset Builder Agent

* controls learning input

---

## 11.5 Counterfactual Agent

* evaluates outcomes

---

## 11.6 Intelligence Agent

* extracts patterns

---

## 11.7 Weight Update Agent

* adjusts system behavior

---

## 11.8 Worker Generator Agent

* creates queue workers

---

## 11.9 Execution & QA Factory

* validates system integrity
* enforces fail-closed

---

# 12. Key System Mechanisms

---

## 12.1 Decision Gate (Mandatory Pattern)

Every decision must:

1. break assumption
2. reframe
3. decide

---

## 12.2 Flip Engine

Cheap traffic → expensive intent

If no flip path → BLOCK

---

## 12.3 Prevented Loss Model

System is priced and evaluated by:

```
loss_prevented
```

Not:

* features
* usage

---

## 12.4 Screener Rule

Every decision includes:

* 60 second friction layer

---

## 12.5 Trust-Based Learning

Only:

```
high_trust + eligible
```

data enters learning

---

# 13. Guardrails

---

### Hard Rules

* No heuristic decisions
* No AI override
* No silent fallback
* No skipping layers
* No direct execution

---

### Failure Handling

| Condition               | Action         |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| invalid input           | fallback       |
| high risk normalization | block learning |
| missing chain           | no evaluation  |
| unsafe scenario         | STOP           |

---

# 14. DevOps Requirements

---

## Infrastructure

* Node.js (TypeScript)
* PostgreSQL
* Redis (BullMQ)
* Make.com
* Cloud provider (AWS / GCP)

---

## Requirements

* idempotent workers
* persistent queues
* retry-safe execution
* audit logging
* monitoring (fail rates, queue depth)

---

# 15. What This System Is NOT

* not a dashboard
* not analytics
* not AI assistant
* not recommendation engine

---

# 16. What This System Actually Does

It sits **between intention and action**
and decides:

> should this action happen?

---

# 17. Final Mental Model

```
Without Plenra:
input → action → loss → analysis

With Plenra:
input → decision → (block OR allow) → outcome → learning
```

---

# 18. Immediate Build Order (Production)

1. Intake Layer (types + validator)
2. Decision Gate Service
3. Ledger Service
4. Dataset Builder
5. Counterfactual Engine
6. Queue Workers (BullMQ)
7. PostgreSQL schema
8. Make.com orchestration
9. Minimal UI

If you want next step, I’ll do one of these:

* full folder structure (ready to clone)
* docker + infra setup
* exact Make.com scenario blueprint
* production deployment checklist

No theory. Only execution.
